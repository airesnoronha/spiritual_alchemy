# Spiritual Alchemy

Spiritual Alchemy is a Minecraft mod that allows players to transmute items using their essence component.
There are five types of essence, based on chinese five elements:

* Water
* Wood
* Fire
* Earth
* Metal

Most vanilla blocks and items already have some attributes assigned to them.

What makes this mod the best choice as an alchemy mod is that all essence converion values can be set in datapacks.
So if you're hosting a server, you can just plug a new datapack on top of the default one and change mod behavior completely.

### What is in the mod already

The mod has now only a transmutation table that can store up to 150 essence of each type with no capability to export.
It's no exaggeration to call it an advanced chest.

### What is planned

* Adding essences to be liquids automatically;
* Adding blocks that breaks items into liquid essences;
* Adding blocks to store and transport liquid essence;
* Adding blocks to recombine essence into items automatically;
* Adding some form of coherent passive generation;
* Adding some form of essence element interchangeability;
